That is, can the Verifier say that an attestation result it generates has an expiration associated?   (Physical passports and drivers licenses for example do have an expiration associated, as do X.509 certificates.)\r\n\r\nOr is the lifetime only implementable by the Relying Party based on other information like a Timestamp in the attestation result and its own appraisal policy for attestation results?\r\n\r\nAnd is there any requirement that a Relying Party and an Attestation Server need roughly synchronized clocks?  (I suspect yes.)\r\n\r\nOffhand, I think that it would be good to allow attestation results to include an expiration timestamp.

The altered behavior has security relevance. Therefore, the trust model should describe the conditions in which acceptance of the message is warranted.

      "body": "Here's some possible text.\r\n\r\nEndorser\r\nThe primary function of an Endorser is to endorse an Attester so that a Verifier can know to trust that Attester. The Endorser does this by creating an Endorsement and conveying it securely to the Verifier. The primary basis for a Verifier trusting an Attester is the Endorsement.\r\n\r\nThere is thus an existential relationship between Attesters and Endorsers.  An Attester with no Endorsement is not worth very much since there is no good basis by which a Verifier can trust it so every Attester needs an Endorser. The Endorser\u2019s primary function is to endorse Attesters so an Endorser doesn\u2019t have anything to do without some Attesters to endorse.\r\n\r\nA Verify cannot do its job without Endorsements. It must have an Endorsement for each Attester from which it received Attestation Evidence. Without this, the Attester is not trusted and there is no basis for trusting the Evidence it produces.\r\n\r\nThere is a trust triangle between the Endorser, Attester and Verifier. The Endorser tells the Verifier that an Attester is trustworthy.\r\n\r\nEndorsement\r\nUltimately an Endorsement must be realized as some input bytes to a Verifier and they must be conveyed securely from the Endorser to the Verifier. RATS architecture does not impose any limit or restriction on the formats of these bytes or the conveyance mechanism.  In practice they are expected to vary quite widely.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the Endorsement will include the key material that is used to verify signatures on the Evidence. Since the Evidence will contain a nonce, this signature verification serves to authenticate the attester. The Endorsement may also contain information about the Attester such as its type, version, manufacturer and such.\r\n\r\nIn one example, the Endorser and the Verifier are the same legal organization, so secure conveyance is entirely an internal issue for the organization. It may consist of one employee copying a set of public keys from computer in the company to another.\r\n\r\nIn another example, the Endorsement may take the form of a PKI hierarchy. The Endorser conveys a root certificate to the Verifier. The Endorser also creates per-attester certificates under that root. Those per-attester certificates are programmed into Attesters. The Attester sends them to the  Verifier attached to the Evidence. There may be several levels of certificates in the PKI hierarchy. The Verifier walks the certificate chain to determine trust.  Note in the case the abstract notion of Endorsement comes to the Verifier in two parts, one in an out-of-band secure conveyance or a root certificate and the other as the signed (self-securing) certificates from the Attester.\r\n\r\nUnendorsed Attesters\r\nThe use of unendorsed Attesters is discouraged because there is no good basis for establishing trust in them. An unendorsed Attester may still have a signing key and produce signed evidence. A Verifier may choose to have some trust in the Evidence they produce by assuming they are trusted on first use (TOFU), building up trust over time after seeing a lot of presumably good attestation evidence, or because it is fed into a machine learning algorithm that correlates to known fraud.  Rats architecture include any facilities, details or designs for this mode of use and explicitly considers it insecure.",

      "body": "The current Section 4.2 text details a hypothetical example aimed at providing clarity of a presumably more abstract concept. However, the concept (illustrated by figure 2) hasn't been explained.\r\n\r\nSuggested wording:\r\nAttestation involving a layered device involves multiple Attesting Environments that collect claims from multiple Target Environments. Attestation \"layering\" exists when the Target Environment contains an Attesting Environment that collects claims for the next layer Target Environment. Layering forms a cascade of target and attesting environments starting with an anchor Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment A) and ending with a leaf Target Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Target Environment C). The leaf environment isn't expected to encapsulate an Attesting Environment. Any number of layered environments (i.e., Figure 2 - Target Environment B / Attesting Environment B) could exist between the anchor and leaf. A hardware execution environment establishes trust in the anchor Attesting Environment (see Section 4.1). \r\n\r\nA Verifier relies on Endorsements for insight regarding trustworthiness of the anchor Attesting Environment. Verifiers may require Endorsements for all the environments. Each Attesting Environment generates Evidence for its respective Target Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Layered Evidence for B and C). \r\n\r\nLayering of Evidence means the first layer Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment A) integrity protects Evidence B and the next layer Attesting Environment (i.e., Figure 2 - Attesting Environment B) integrity protects Evidence C.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI stopped short of describing use of keys for integrity protection, whether or not the same or different keys can be used or where the keys are stored / protected. By inference, the attesting environments either have them locally or can use them by keyID or some other way. I also stopped short of describing how the Verifier disambiguates Evidence B from Evidence C or how each evidence instance is attributed to its proper attesting environment. If it is important to describe this then maybe more words are needed?\r\n\r\nI think the remainder of the section could more efficiently describe the BIOS / PC boot use case relying more on the terminology in Figure 2 to describe a mapping from the abstraction in Figure 2 to an example implementation.",

A simple realization of the architecture associates a single role to a single entity; for example, the topological models described in section 5.1 and 5.2 follow this convention. However, entities may host multiple roles as a way to accommodate more sophisticated use cases and deployment scenarios. An entity that both connects to a wide-area network and to a system bus may play both Attester and Verifier roles. As a system bus entity, a Verifier consumes Evidence from other devices connected to the system bus that implement an Attester role. As a wide-area network connected entity, it may implement an Attester role. The entity, as a system bus Verifier, may choose to fully isolate its role as a wide-area network Attester. Alternatively, attestation results might reflect an aggregation of system bus operational state claims in the form of Evidence. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the Composite Device scenario, the lead Attester...\r\n<paste remainder of paragraph from section 4.3>\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the introduction section should change \"role composition\" terminology to \"topological models\" as it references Passport.

          "body": "Going back to Laurence\u2019s original request. The observation he is making is that both the Endorser and the Appraisal Policy for Evidence Owner entities can say what is a \u2018reference\u2019 or \u2018known good\u2019 value. Presumably, an Owner entity did some due diligence to ensure the KGV is indeed \u2018good\u2019 given Owners may not have access to source code or other tools that the original vendor has access to. But ultimately, all appraisal decisions are qualified by the Owner\u2019s wishes.\r\n\r\nThere is complexity in ecosystems when a vendor (e.g. BIOS vendor) doesn\u2019t give up ownership of the FW even though the computer is sold to the customer. The PC owner might have a policy that allows the BIOS vendor to supply an Appraisal policy for just the BIOS. The Roles architecture for the BIOS component may differ from the Roles architecture for other components. In this case, the Endorsement and Policy roles may be supplied by the same Entity (i.e. the bios vendor).\r\n\r\nSee more inline below - Nms>\r\n\r\nFrom: ericvoit <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Friday, April 3, 2020 at 5:54 AM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\nHi Eric, Dave,\r\nI'd just add one more restriction to the list... if \"known good values\" means \"if the measured hash in a PCR is exactly this value then we're good\", the domain has to be narrowed to single-threaded well-known software instances, e.g., the components of a BIOS.\r\nNms> Endorsements and KGVs are synonyms AFA the Architecture is concerned. I think some people may interpret that phrase to be specific to FW digest values. But I don\u2019t think of it that way. Any claim can be asserted as being \u201cgood\u201d by the vendor of the asset that the claim applies.\r\nNms> The conversation around TPM PCRs adds a layer of abstraction that can be confusing at times. A PCR is a hash tree. The \u201cEvent Log\u201d is the actual tree that was hashed. The RATS Architecture defines several patterns for how a device might be constructed (e.g. Composite Device, Layered Device,\u2026) These structures can be decomposed into hash trees and integrity protected using a TPM. Or they can be decomposed into other Evidence structures that may included certificates, EAT tokens or CoSWIDs (or something else for that matter). Hopefully, the industry will consolidate around a few possibilities (hence the architecture\u2019s attention to patterns).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complexity of known-good-values comes with asynchronous threads such as IMA in Linux; in that case, the hash in the TPM PCR can only serve as a check on the (perhaps huge) number of individual hashes in the log file, each of which needs its own Known Good Value. Hence the SWID tags.\r\nNms> This is more of a scalability scenario IMO because IMA is trying to track changes in a dynamic environment. While much of the attention for attestation, initially, has been around asset tracking, onboarding and boot scenarios where the dynamics of what can change is greatly restricted.\r\nNms> The overarching goal for Endorsement is for the Verifier to correlate it with Evidence, and vice versa. The dynamics of both need to be comprehended. In the Freshness section of the architecture the focus has been on Evidence dynamics. There is also the concept of Endorsement freshness to consider. The challenge for the architecture is how much attention should be given to this when Endorsement is out of scope for the WG?\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm certainly not qualified to say how all this would work in EAT- or TEEP-land...\r\n/guy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuniper Business Use Only\r\nFrom: Eric Voit (evoit) <evoit@cisco.com>\r\nSent: Thursday, April 2, 2020 4:14 PM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>; ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>; Smith, Ned <ned.smith@intel.com>; Guy Fedorkow <gfedorkow@juniper.net>\r\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: RE: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say they are never sufficient.

For example, section 7.2 says \u201cdevices from a given manufacturer have information matching a set of known-good reference values,\u201d and \u201cThus, an Endorsement may be helpful information in authenticating information about a device, but is not necessarily sufficient to authorize access to resources which may need device-specific information such as a public key for the device\u201d\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this is scant and leaves a lot to the reader to figure out or make assumption. The architecture could more clearly capture the idea that Endorsements are \u201creference\u201d claims that are compared with Evidence claims to validate their correctness. It should introduce other common terms such as \u2018known good values\u2019, \u2018reference values\u2019 and \u2018endorsed values\u2019 as roughly synonymous.\r\n\r\nI think it should go further to say that Endorsements can include values that are static (intrinsic) that don\u2019t require attestation, but can be asserted about a class of device, platform, entity and appraised according to an appraisal policy for Evidence (Even though the claims don\u2019t appear in Evidence).\r\n\r\nWhile I think it is possible to interpret the existing wording according to the above understanding, it is also possible to interpret it differently. Therefore, the section should be improved.\r\n\r\nI also think the first sentence (and definition in terminology) are insufficient. While \u201cAn Endorsement is a secure statement that some entity (e.g., a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of the device\u2019s signing capability.\u201d \u2013 is correct, it is insufficient because it is also a statement about the devices Attesting Environment ability to collect claims securely.\r\n\r\nFrom: Laurence Lundblade <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Monday, April 6, 2020 at 3:04 PM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: \"Smith, Ned\" <ned.smith@intel.com>, Comment <comment@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] describe known-good values (#78)\r\n\r\n\r\n> On Apr 6, 2020, at 12:15 PM, Ned Smith <notifications@github.com> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> The challenge for the architecture is how much attention should be given to this when Endorsement is out of scope for the WG?\r\n\r\nThe architecture doc should (must?) facilitate a good understanding of attestation end-end for the reader.\r\n\r\nK-g-v seem like a very core concept to attestation.

Is it intentional that the methods to establish trust is different for { Endorser, Verified Owner } and the Relying Party? I believe that the Relying Party may require Evidence from the Verifier to trust it, in fact, this is precisely how the Microsoft Azure Attestation Service (a Verifier) has been designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nNMS> I don\u2019t think it is the intent of the arch doc to say that it expects different entities should use different techniques to establish initial trust. The trust model assumes, however, the various role interactions have pre-requisite trust relationships. It isn\u2019t a goal of the architecture to define how to bootstrap or establish pre-requisite trust relationships. Some suggestions are provided, but maybe it makes sense to discuss it in one part of the document only?\r\n\r\nTopic 2: conceptual dataflow diagram. The conceptual dataflow diagram in the architecture spec does not currently reflect that the Verifier may also be an Attester and then share Evidence with the Endorser, Verifier Owner and Relying Party. Should it be updated? Or have a 2nd more complex diagram?\r\n\r\nNMS> The conceptual model is intended to present a canonical model (one that is simplified) and leave it up to targeted designs to determine how best to apply more complex interactions. Nevertheless, the case for using Attestation as a way to establish pre-requisite trust between the Roles may not be the best example of \u201ccomplex Role interactions\u201d since the assumption/presumption that pre-requisite trust between Roles / entities has already been addressed (somehow). Rather, more interesting / complex interactions might be something like the composite device where a local Verifier appraises some of the Sub-Attesters\u2019 Evidence but not all of it. In this case there is both local and remote Verifiers. The remote Verifier is implementing the Relying Party role to the local Verifier\u2019s Attestation Results. It may be generating its own Attestation Results and combining both sets of Attestation Results for consumption by other Relying Parties. We don\u2019t say the remote Verifier isn\u2019t a Relying Party; rather we say the entity that hosts the remote Verifier may also host a Relying Party role (to the local Verifier).\r\n\r\nThere has been continued discussion about the differences between a role and the entity that implements / hosts the role(s). Often it is convenient to refer to the entity using the Role name, but that becomes confusing if the entity hosts multiple roles. I think the architecture design team is hopeful that drafts will be careful to distinguish the differences as they can draw upon use case context to name entities according to use case intuition rather than by using Role names.\r\n\r\nTopic 3: EAT. If accurate, I'd like to see a clear acknowledgement that the Verifier may need to act as an Attester for the Relying Party since I'd like to then see specifically how the IETF EAT specification covers this circumstance. In other words, for an EAT that represents an AttestationResult, would the Evidence for the Verifier be embedded or discovered? If embedded, how are submods distinguished for the Verifier's Evidence versus the AttestationResult's embedded claims, including nested EAT's?\r\n\r\nNMS> The EAT draft is primarily defining a set of claims. Although, philosophically signed (integrity protected claims) are more correctly referred to as Evidence, Endorsement or Attestation Results (because of who signed them and what Role they were playing when signing them). The architecture thinks (unsigned) claims could be expressions that are suitable as Evidence, Endorsements or Attestation Results. The context of how claims are asserted determines which Role Message term is best.\r\n\r\nI sorta think the example in Topic 3 conflates pre-requisite trust establishment between entities performing RATS Roles with the operational use case of Attesting a pledge device. Recursive application of RATS architecture is possible, as a way to bootstrap a deployment of RATS Roles. But it seems wrong to conflate the recursion to somehow define the Roles differently.\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture/issues/92>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABPMCSH56ORV5YNUXR7OF4LRVEKX5ANCNFSM4NUDAUOQ>.\r\n",

My text now is about that the Lead Attester has a Verifier role inside. \r\n\r\nMaybe we can divide the remote attestation for the composite devices into two cases:\r\n1. Lead Attester has no local Verifier role. The Lead Attester just collects the Evidence of other Attesters, then it integrates all these Evidence into one Evidence of the whole composite device (with no or little local processing of the collected Evidence), and it conveys the final Evidence to the Verifier.\r\n2. Lead Attester has a local Verifier role. Then after collecting the Evidence of other attesters, the Lead Attester can verify these Evidence and integrates the verification results into the final Evidence of the whole device. This can help reduce the bandwidth for transporting the Evidence between the device and the Verifier, and also can reduce the load of the Verifier. This may be very helpful when the number of devices is large.",

So the host processor first takes on the role of Verifier to verify the modem whether trustworthy and on the whitelist, and then it takes on the role of Relying Party to consume the Attestation Result.\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph, the role combinations can be arbitrary. And this paragraph just gives one example where the entity takes on the role of Attester and Verifier, to show how role combination works.",

The Verifier needs to be told that the root-of-trust / secure element environment exists. It can happen manually, such as an IT department physically issuing a smart card or smart device with a SE to a user, generating the key pair, update the Verifier to trust the public that was generated. Manual approaches work in IT environments where employees are subject to IT procedures. Manual processes may not scale to Internet ecosystems. Remote attestation is trying to go beyond manual processes by generating keys in devices by manufacturers and issuing machine certs that establish that a key is protected by a secure element. This seems like a basic idea that if it isn't clear might belong in the introduction?",

For example, if the HSM was designed to have exposed a shared memory region that is shared with the Target Environment\u2019s executable code pages.\r\n\r\nFrom: Dave Thaler <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Tuesday, March 17, 2020 at 12:38 PM\r\nTo: ietf-rats-wg/architecture <architecture@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: \"Smith, Ned\" <ned.smith@intel.com>, Review requested <review_requested@noreply.github.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [ietf-rats-wg/architecture] Reference diagram showing two types of environments (#70)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't understand the text Ned added.\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nYou are receiving this because your review was requested.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/ietf-rats-wg/architecture/pull/70#issuecomment-600259968>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABPMCSAAWLUKUFZNWTES35DRH7GQRANCNFSM4LNVOYBQ>.\r\n",

              "body": "The examples use RATS Roles context to show relevance of the time consideration. The roles architecture doesn't elevate Attesting Environment and Target Environment to the same status (not arguing to do that either). There is however time considerations that apply between TE and AE interactions. The security consideration (which may be contrived) is that the target environment may exhibit one set of claims at value creation and a different set at value collection / measurement. This could happen if attack code has control of the TE and presents one set of claims at time of collection then reverts back to the other set (and presumably continues execution with the attacker's claims). I can convince myself that if the AE and TE were secure by design, that the scenario shouldn't happen. However, it is a common mistake that measurement of code is taken before it is loaded, but modified after being loaded, but the collected evidence always reports what was though to be loaded not what is actually loaded. If it is important to capture this common mistake. Maybe it belongs in security considerations?",

RP2 gives another result expiry to RP2. So RP2 has 2 result expiry times. Maybe Ned wants to emphasize that RP2 has to make a choice between these two times.\r\nBut RP can also have other expiry policies that come from other sources, e.g., the administrator configures an expiry time. I think it's up to the implementation to consider how to make decisions among all the policies.

If RX is only a function of a Verifier then the use case doesn't make sense. If RX can be asserted by RP to other RPs, then that implies RX can be a \"Remediation action\" from a RP; which we said might be OK for TEEP arch to define but is likely out of scope for RATS. I prefer to place limits on \"who can say what\" to limit combinatorics and therefore limits the potential for insecure states. Dave T. seems to be saying that unless there is a use case, it doesn't make sense to define the freshness variable. But even with already defined variables it is possible to find insecure states unless some other constraints are acknowledged. Maybe both perspectives can be held simultaneously? \r\n\r\nEven if we limit RX to Verifier only. An (out-of-scope?) RP1 to RP2 flow could define different RX (RX2) that leaves RP2 in the same undecidability state that Pan Wei points out. But I don't think the arch can prevent the possibility for unsecure states. Nevertheless, I'm still an advocate for specifying which entity is expected to make which freshness claim. Put the burden of proof on the use case to justify when it makes sense for other entities to make the freshness claim. ",

It seems to be focusing on the composite device but highlighting the case where composite attesters could be network connected. However, I'm not certain based on this text.

Maybe sticking to a few intuitive examples is best. e.g., verifier + relying party, endorser + verifier and maybe verifier+owner. Combining attester and verifier is problematic because the trust model objective is to separate attester from verifier. ",

The main point of line/paragraph 481 is that an entity can host (combine) multiple roles. When that happens, the role messages between roles on peer entities remains true to the roles architecture. For example, if Verifier and RP are combined. Evidence still flows to Verifier and RP still consumes Appraisal policy for Attestation Results (even though there isn't an Attestation Results flow exposed externally to the entity). ",

It's good to provide a bit of context and clarifying information around freshness, but I don't see the need for a big taxonomical effort :-)\r\n\r\nI think the concepts could be condensed in a couple of paragraphs, like:\r\n```\r\nFreshness has two dimensions: recentness and uniqueness.\r\n\r\nUniqueness is conveyed via a non-repeatable value sourced, for example,\r\nfrom a high quality randomness pool, a \u201cgranular enough\u201d clock, a serial\r\nnumber that doesn\u2019t wrap-around, etc.  In the context of Evidence and\r\nAttestation Results, uniqueness can be encoded into a \"nonce\" attribute.\r\n\r\nRecentness is conveyed via either a relative or absolute timestamp - \r\nassociated with the time of collection of claims by the attester, or the\r\ntime the attestation report is produced \u2014 and an either explicit\r\nor implicit \u201cexpiry\u201d value that determines the threshold between\r\nacceptable (i.e. recent enough) and non-acceptable (i.e., too old)\r\nvalues of the timestamp. It assumes time synchronisation between\r\nproducers and consumers.    In the context of Evidence and Attestation\r\nResults, recentness can be encoded using a \"timestamp\" and \"expiry\"\r\nattributes.\r\n```\r\nor similar.  Cheers!",

If the initiator happens to also have:\r\n1) a clock, and\r\n2) a notion of expiry\r\n\r\nthen some form of _rough_ recentness, i.e., one that:\r\n\r\n1) can't distinguish between creation time and collection time of claims;\r\n2) applies to the whole claims set as opposed to individual claims\r\n\r\ncan be built even _without_ a synchronised clock at the responder.\r\n\r\nIs this what the quoted sentence really means to you?\r\n\r\nIf so, I think we can craft some text together that is short and to the point.\r\n\r\nThat said, and again thanks very much for this further edit pass, I'd be still OK with just dropping this PR altogether.\r\n",

Alternatively, a challenger can simply establish a similar bi-lateral trust relationship by conducting a Challenge/Response handshake here. It is a smaller scoped trust relationship, it is temporary, and the challenger must at least be RESTful in order not to forget that it created the nonce in the Challenge.

Again, maybe I am missing something very obvious. Could you provide me with a protocol-based exemplary use of a nonce, generated by the challenger, where the reply that uses the nonce (most likely in a \"sealed\" way, such as digital signing) does not bear a proof-of-recentness by using that nonce in its reply?\r\n> \r\n> This is IMO \u201cfreshness by uniqueness\u201d, in fact it doesn\u2019t require a clock nor an expiry to work, just a non-repeating source of byte strings.\r\n\r\nWell, the Verifier has to retain state, \"remembering the nonce\" until a certain time-out, which I think most certainly requires a clock.

Typically \"freshness\" is used without context here.

              "body": "Okay :-) Let me rephrase that. A Challenger that intends to retrieve Evidence in a finite time, has a clock, and that intends to obtain a notion of recentness can track a time interval only using its clock to do this. The indicator for the duration here (duration being a time interval where the left time is an epoch starting with 0 at which the Challenge including a nonce is emitted and at the right time evidence including a digest of a nonce is received) is the time that has passed between Challenge and Response.\r\n\r\nVery small RESTful interactions as enabled via CoAP enable this (even with using an observe option) notion of recentness - intrinsically. Retaining state for an operation is not an implementation detail, I think. It is, for example required to associate CoAP tokens. Typically protocols use time-outs to avoid waiting until the end of the universe - and I think that is not an implementation detail, too, but an interaction model capability. The binding to what you call an transaction here, which typically is a operation I think, is what is the essential part to get a notion of recentness. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to your point, my point is that a re-use of a nonce that is cryptographically (and in this case uniquely) \"bound\" to a Response does not require synchronized clocks due to the \"recentness\" based on the uniqueness that is provided by the \"arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication\" (nonce) intrinsically.\r\n\r\nEdit: maybe this will also help us to converge here :-)\r\nRFC4949 definition of a nonce\r\nA random or non-repeating value that is included in data exchanged by a protocol, usually for the purpose of guaranteeing liveness and thus detecting and protecting gainst replay attacks.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, I think:\r\n\r\n1.) \"recentness by uniqueness\" is an over-simplification (you could receive two responses based on the same nonce, violating uniqueness wrt the nonce, and still only process the most recent response via sequence or clock use), and\r\n2.) \"recentness needs synchronized clocks between requestor and responder and is conveyed via a timestamp plus an expiration threshold associated with the provided evidence / attestation result.\" is not correct, due to being too specific (you do not always need synchronized clocks) and unnecessary limiting (you do not necessarily need time-stamps and or expiration dates).\r\n\r\nIf I would only look at the interaction model of TUDA, I would agree! :-) But looking at charra, tuda and subscribed evidence, I think I still cannot agree.\r\n\r\nEdit: I think I have to highlight that this is about the conveyance of evidence - only! As noted in another comment, a \"time of validity\" for, e.g. Attestation Results, is another matter of \"freshness\" that is not addressed in the current text. \r\n\r\n",

The section now states clearly that the overall goal is instead\r\nthe identification of the point in time when attestation claims have\r\nbeen signed and/or generated so that a freshness policy can be applied.\r\nIn this perspective, the fundamental property provided by a nonce-based\r\nscheme with regards to freshness is its ability to lock the requester's\r\nclock to the underlying protocol transaction, thus indirectly\r\nestablishing the epoch of the attestation / verification event.  By\r\nmaking the nonce unique and non-predictable, the timeline locking cannot\r\nbe subverted, which provides anti-replay.  However, that is a nice\r\nside-effect rather than the primary goal.\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds some precision around the nonce and clock\r\nproperties - unpredictability and trustworthiness respectively.",

In particular, by using \"solely\" I wanted to discuss the case where the only clock that the appraiser can trust is its own.  The intent of line 870 is just to illustrate two common instances where the appraiser can't rely on the peer's clock.\r\n\r\nThe overall premise for this whole paragraph is that appraiser does _not_ consider any time assertion made the peer, and to determine what kind of information can be used in this case to evaluate freshness.\r\n\r\nClearly, once the peer's clock becomes usable - as in the example at line 880 - then finer-grained timestamping can become input to the evaluation of the freshness policy as well.\r\n\r\nHopefully I have made my intention clear and the ambiguities in the existing text can be fixed accordingly :-)",
